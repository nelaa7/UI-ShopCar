                <h5 class="card-title">Datsun 240Z Fairlady</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The Nissan S30, sold in Japan as the Nissan Fairlady Z and in other markets as the Datsun 240Z, 
                    then later as the 260Z and 280Z, is a grand tourer produced by Nissan from 1969 until 1978. 
                    The S30 was conceived of by Yutaka Katayama, the President of Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A., and designed by a team 
                    led by Yoshihiko Matsuo, the head of Nissan's Sports Car Styling Studio.[1] It is the first car 
                    in Nissan's Z series of sports cars. <br> <br>

                    Aiming to compete directly with established European sports cars, 
                    Datsun priced the new 240Z within $200 of the British MGB-GT in the United States, 
                    a five-year-old design that showed its age. The 240Z's styling, engineering, relatively 
                    low price, and impressive performance resonated with the public, received a positive response 
                    from both buyers and the motoring press, and immediately generated long waiting lists. <br><br>
                    
                    As a halo car, the 240Z broadened the acceptance of Japanese car-makers beyond 
                    their economy image. Datsun's growing dealer 
                    network—compared to limited production imported sports cars manufactured by Jaguar, 
                    BMW, Porsche, Alfa Romeo, and Fiat—ensured both easy purchase and ready maintenance. <br><br>
                    
                    All variants of the S30 have four-wheel independent suspension consisting 
                    of MacPherson struts in the front (borrowed from the Nissan Laurel C30) and Chapman struts in the back. 
                    Front disc brakes and rear drums were standard. <br><br>
                    
                    The 240Z used twin SU-style Hitachi one-barrel side-draft carburettors. These were replaced on the 
                    260Z with Hitachi one-barrel side-draft carburettors beginning with model year 1973 to comply with emissions 
                    regulations, resulting in diminished overall performance. A Bosch-designed L-Jetronic 
                    electronic fuel injection was added to US market 280Zs in 1975 to compensate. <br><br>
                    
                    Continuing through the 1975–1978 model years, markets outside of the United States 
                    (and Japan, which only offered the 2-liter engine from 1974) still received the 260Z coupé and 2+2.
                     The S30 240Z is unrelated to the later 240SX, which is sold as the Silvia in Japan.
                    
                     <br><br>
                     The 1970 240Z was introduced to the American market by Yutaka Katayama, president of Nissan Motors USA operations, 
                     widely known as "Mister K". The early cars from 1969 to mid-1971 had some subtle differences 
                     compared to late-71 to 1973 cars. The most visible difference is: these early cars had a chrome 240Z 
                     badge on the sail pillar, and two horizontal vents in the rear hatch below the glass molding providing 
                     flow through ventilation. In mid-1971, there were production changes, including exterior and interior colors, 
                     was restyling of the sail pillar emblems were with just the letter Z placed in a circular vented emblem, and 
                     the vents were eliminated from the hatch panel of the car, due to complaints of exhaust being circulated into the car. 
                     Design changes for the US model 240Z occurred throughout production but were not always 
                     reflected in the JDM Fairlady if they were specific to federal requirements, including interior modifications 
                     for the 1972 model year and a change in the location of the bumper over-riders, as well as the addition of some emission control devices and the adoption of a new style of emissions reducing carburetors for the 1973 model year.
