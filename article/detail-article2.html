                <p class="card-text">Toyota does not produce many sports cars throughout its history. However,
                    each sports car that Toyota has ever produced, such as the 2000GT and the Supra, gain the fame
                    they deserve. Among the most sought models in history, the Toyota AE86 may be the fittest to
                    become an icon in the world car village. <br><br>

                    Referring to Toyota, people will immediately think of a reliable, fuel-efficient, and
                    family-friendly
                    car brand. When it comes to building its cars or releasing a new version, it’s rare for the Japanese
                    automaker to make revolutionary changes. <br><br>

                    They may change the chassis design, modify the interior, or increase the engine power slightly to
                    make
                    their car better. But it is rare for them to innovate anything to the utmost. It is that principle
                    that has turned Toyota into the largest car manufacturer in the world. <br><br>

                    Toyota has conquered most car segments in the market, but sports cars are the segment where they
                    have
                    shown weakness at many points. However, with every sports car launched, Toyota makes a difference.
                    <br><br>

                    Toyota’s sports cars are often unlike any other model on the market. The world’s largest car
                    manufacturer
                    has never focused on engine power but has always committed to providing an enjoyable driving
                    experience to
                    conquer the hearts of dynamic speed and sports enthusiasts. <br><br>

                    With the Toyota Sprinter Trueno AE86, Toyota’s legendary sports car that has been continuing the
                    unique tradition
                    of the Japanese manufacturer. Let’s take a look at a few reasons why you should own this popular
                    model in the 80s. <br><br>

                    With all the mentioned characteristics, you may become more curious about this legendary model. Here
                    are some reasons why you should buy the Toyota Corolla AE86 for unforgettable driving experience.
                    <br><br>

                    <h5>The versatility in modification and customization of the Toyota AE86</h5>
                    For the AE86 series, in addition to changing the entire lineup appearance, such as adding wings or
                    chassis robustness, there have been significant modifications. The modified Toyota AE86 projects are
                    available in all corners with many worthy-to-experience outcomes.

                    </div>

                    Professionals can execute Toyota AE86 upgrades such as reducing its weight compared to its
                    predecessor, which can differ by up to 70 kg, and show the effect of saving fuel.
                    <br><br>
                    However, this model’s external dimensions are almost unchanged, so if you are interested in any
                    dimension-adjustment car modification, you may feel a bit disappointed and have to turn to others.

                    well with the price of the Toyota AE86.
